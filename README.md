# Object Detection with Vertex AI and AutoML

Repository for the Object Detection with Vertex AI and AutoML talk which was presented at the October 2022 [GDG Phoenix meetup](https://www.meetup.com/phx-android/).

# What's Included

- [Slide deck](https://github.com/danielbank/object-detection/blob/main/docs/Object_Detection_with_Vertex_AI_and_AutoML.pdf): Slide deck for the talk in PDF format
- [Example Android App](https://github.com/danielbank/object-detection/tree/main/android): A copy paste of the [TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android) with [dice detection TFLite model](https://github.com/danielbank/object-detection/blob/main/android/app/src/main/assets/model.tflite) trained using the [Six-Sided Dice Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nellbyler/d6-dice) from Kaggle
